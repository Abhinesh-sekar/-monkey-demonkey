This is a simple encryption-decryption program. To use it, first use the file keymaker.py to create an array of jumbled ASCII characters, which will be stored in a .npy file. Next, use the monkey.py file to encrypt a given phrase in a .txt file. The monkey.py file will ask for a key number, which is the index of the particular jumbled word in the array. When you are done encrypting, a text file will be created on your desktop. You can use this file to decrypt the encrypted text using the demonkey.py file. The demonkey.py file will ask for the key number, and you must use the same key number that you used to encrypt the text.
